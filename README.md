## ðŸ¤“ WEBINAR SERIES ON Trends in Mechatronics  amd IOT enabling world of Artificial Intelligence

The goal of this course is to create awareness about recent trends that demands the mechatronics and IOT engineers to deploy Artifitially Intelligent model.ðŸš€

Technology is in an evolving state and the concept the Internet of Things which is all about interconnection of machines and devices to network through sensors, network, communication protocols, analytics and specific softwares is trying to work its was to mechatronics. This is a relatively new concept though engineering in mechatronics existed for more than half a century.

With increasing number of smart devices, industries are wiring themselves to an upgraded version of Mechtaronics in order  to being about an ease to mechanical processes and systems.

The focus of this series is **to counter the rumors** across the world that **Internet of Things** is compelling **mechatronics engineers, aspirants, enthusiasts and academia** to develop and research new mechatronic systems and components while facing **new issues of  human- machine interface, connectivity and transmission, data security** and many more.ðŸš€

> **Internet of Things** it self is an outcome of what mechatronics engineer do :metal:
